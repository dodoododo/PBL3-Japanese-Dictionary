# JapanEasy Japanese Dictionary

## Description

JapanEasy is a Japanese-English dictionary web app built with React and Java Spring Boot with SQL for database. It allows users to look up words, learn by JLPT Levels and create customizable Flashcards/PDFs. Everything you need to conveniently learn Japanese is developed in this all-in-one application

## Reason For Development

Currently there are many great online dictionaries for Japanese-English translations but each websites provides its own unique feature, and sometimes that feature needs to be paid for to access. We studied all the good sides of each website to create this dictionary that includes everything you need FOR FREE, it is to be used by Japanese learners all over the world 

## Future Updates And Expansions 

We acknowledged that the site is only usable if you already know English initialy. We will develop the site to adapt to more languages. 

Another update could be to expand our dictionary to not only work on the site but on other sites. Our idea is, you can apply words you choosed to be highlighted in other websites, such as when reading Japanese newspaper, the word will highlight and you can hover your cursor to see that word's meaning. It's a useful and strong feature that leaners can use to better study Japanese in real context
